**Inkporter** is a powerful tool to help your productivity with Inkscape. This tool is available as a Command Line Interface and Inkscape Extension, so you can choose the best option for you.

## How It Works
Inkporter reads ID patterns (i.e icon-1, icon-2, icon-3, etc) that you've set and then exports them to the file format that you need. Inkporter allows you to feel like you are working with artboards or multiple pages in Inkscape.

## Inkporter Features
Artboard-like export
Multiple PDF Page Export (Booklet)
JPG and PDF with CMYK export
And various export formats for productivity (PNG, JPG, SVG, EPS, PDF, and WEBP)
